Overview: 
Data is taken from Montesinho Park in Portugal. There are 13 separate variables found in the dataset. X-Spatial coordinate, Y-Spatial coordinate, Month, Day, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, Temp, RH (relative humidity), Wind, Rain, Area.
Variable "FFMC" is a numeric rating that measures the moisture content of litter and other fuels (Ranges from 0-101). Variable "DMC" is a numeric rating of average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth. Variable "DC" is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. Variable "ISI" is a numeric rating of the expected rate of fire spread.

Background: 
This dataset comes from Paulo Cortez and Anibal Morais from the Department of Information Systems/R&D Algoritmi Centre at the University of Minho in Guimaraes, Portugal. The data is from the Montesinho natural park which is located in the Northeast region of Portugal and it the data collected is from January 2000 to December 2003. It was collected using meteorological stations and local sensors, along with the daily recording of specific features of any occuring forest fires. More information on this dataset is available at http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/fires.pdf.
